# The Matrix Exponential and Matrix Lie Groups
*Lie Groups with Applications – Quantum Formalism Series*

This interactive Jupyter notebook was created as a supplement to **Lecture 1** of the [Lie Groups with Applications](https://quantumformalism.academy/lie-groups-with-applications) course, produced by [Quantum Formalism](https://quantumformalism.academy) in partnership with Zaiku Group. The focus of this first lecture is the **matrix exponential**, a foundational tool in the study of Lie groups, with deep connections to linear algebra, differential equations, and symmetry.

## 🌟 Key Concepts

- What is a **matrix Lie group**?
- The **matrix exponential** as a power series: convergence, properties, and geometric meaning
- Exponential maps as solutions to linear ODEs
- Examples from classical groups: $GL(n), SL(n), O(n), SO(n)$
- Diagonalization, Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, and numerical computation using `scipy.linalg.expm`

## 🧑‍💻 What's in the Notebook?

- Numerical and symbolic demonstrations of $e^X$ for real and complex matrices
- Visualizations of Lie group actions and structure-preserving flows
- Worked examples tied to core theorems from the lecture
- Interactive cells for exploring your own matrices and their exponentials

## 🎓 Audience & Prerequisites

This material is designed for:
- Learners new to **Lie theory**
- Students of **linear algebra**, **differential equations**, or **quantum mechanics**
- Researchers and developers in **machine learning**, **control theory**, or **physics**

A working knowledge of basic matrix algebra and calculus is assumed. No prior background in Lie groups is required.

## 📚 About the Series

This notebook is part of a growing educational series on **Lie Groups and Their Applications**, produced by [Quantum Formalism](https://quantumformalism.academy), whose mission is to make abstract mathematics accessible, visual, and empowering.
